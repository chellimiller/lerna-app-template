# lerna-app-template

Template for a more advanced project that includes a React app and PWA managed by Lerna.

## Why use Lerna?

Beyond a simple app, some projects require a backend and complex service worker.

Using Lerna allows us to keep our project's code neatly separated.
Lerna also allows us to still manage these separate projects together.
