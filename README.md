# lerna-app-template

Template for a more advanced project that includes a React app and PWA managed by Lerna.

## Why use Lerna?

Beyond a simple app, some projects require a backend and complex service worker.

Using Lerna allows us to keep our project's code neatly separated.
Lerna also allows us to still manage these separate projects together.

## Usage Instructions

1. Use the template to create your project repository in Github.
1. Clone your project and run `npm run setup`.
1. Run `npm start` to start the server.
1. Open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser window.
